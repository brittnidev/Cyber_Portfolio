# Configuring and Testing Basic Network Connectivity 

I completed this guided project focused on Configuring and Testing Basic Network Connectivity. It’s designed for IT security professionals and aspiring network engineers who want to build foundational network skills in a simulated environment.

## Project Overview

- Objective: I configured and tested basic network connectivity by managing configurations on Cisco devices (IP addressing, virtual interfaces, DHCP servers) and verifying end-to-end connectivity.
- Environment: Entirely simulated using Cisco devices (via Packet Tracer). I practiced as if I had access to real devices.
- Outcome: By the end, I was able to configure small-scale computer networks and validate end-to-end connectivity.
- Unique value: Introductory, practical network skills suitable for beginners and professionals, with an instructor-guided approach in a split-screen video format.

## Who This Is For

- IT security professionals needing to demonstrate foundational networking knowledge.

## Prerequisites

- Solid background in computer networks (recommended).
- Cisco Networking Academy ID required to access Packet Tracer for this project.

## How the Guided Project Works

The instructor guides you through each step in a video that plays alongside your work area. I performed the following tasks:

- Introductory task
- Saving configurations on Cisco devices
- IP addressing basics and configuration
- Configuring virtual interfaces on Cisco switches
- Practice task 1
- Testing network connectivity (end-to-end)
- Configure automatic IP addresses with DHCP servers
- Capstone task: configure and manage access to Cisco devices

## Learning Outcomes

- I understand IP addressing fundamentals (IPv4 and basic IPv6 concepts as applicable).
- I configured IP addresses on routers and switches.
- I set up and managed virtual interfaces and VLANs on Cisco switches.
- I deployed and configured DHCP servers for automatic IP assignment.
- I verified end-to-end connectivity using common network tests (ping, traceroute, etc.).
- I gained confidence in configuring access to Cisco devices in a controlled environment.

## Project Modules / Workflow

1. Introductory Task
   - Overview of the network topology and goals
   - Prepare environment and verify access to Packet Tracer

2. Saving Configuration on Cisco Devices
   - Save running configuration to startup configuration
   - Understand why saving configuration matters for persistence

3. IP Addressing Basics
   - Plan IP addressing scheme
   - Assign IP addresses to routers, hosts, and interfaces

4. Configuring Virtual Interfaces on Cisco Switches
   - Create and configure VLANs
   - Assign interfaces to appropriate VLANs
   - Configure inter-VLAN routing on the router if applicable

5. Practice Task 1
   - Apply learned concepts in a guided practice scenario
   - Validate basic connectivity within the local network

6. Testing Network Connectivity
   - Use diagnostic tools (ping, traceroute, show commands)
   - Verify reachability between devices across the network

7. Configure DHCP Servers
   - Set up DHCP pools (scopes), default gateway, and DNS options
   - Ensure hosts receive dynamic IPs and can communicate

8. Capstone Task: Configure and Manage Access to Cisco Devices
   - Implement access controls (console/VTY) as appropriate
   - Practice secure management best practices (passwords, banners, etc.)

## Recommended Experience & Access

- Strong background in computer networking
- A Cisco Networking Academy ID to access Packet Tracer resources

## What I’ll Build

- A small, functional network topology with:
  - Routers and switches configured for basic connectivity
  - DHCP server providing dynamic IP addresses
  - Proper VLAN setup and inter-VLAN routing (where applicable)
  - Verified end-to-end communication between hosts

## Artifacts I Included in the Repo

- Network topology diagram (e.g., using draw.io or Visio)
- Packet Tracer project file (.pkt) or a well-documented script of configurations
- Sample CLI commands used for configurations
- Screenshots of successful ping tests, traceroutes, and DHCP leases
- A short test plan and results summary

## How I Used This Repository

- Clone this repo and open the Packet Tracer project as instructed by the video guide.
- Replace placeholders with my actual configurations and test results.
- Document any challenges and how I resolved them for enhanced learning.

## Potential Additions (Optional)

- An index of commands used for each device (router/switch)
- A test matrix showing device/interfaces tested and expected vs. actual results
- A lightweight lab guide for extending the topology (e.g., adding WAN links or additional VLANs)
